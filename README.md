# flat_tree

Flat widget tree

# Purpose

Usually Flutter widgets tree code looks like this:

![Classic widget tree look](docs/classic.png){width=400px}

My main purpose was to decrease code size and increase code readability.
This package can do it in some cases. Take a look:

![Flat tree code look](docs/flat_tree.png){width=300px}

Tree hierarchy was reduced to simple list.

Please check example and learn how to use widget:
