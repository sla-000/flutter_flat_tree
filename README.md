# flat_tree

Flat widget tree

# Purpose

Usually Flutter widgets tree code looks somewhere like this:

<img src="docs/classic.png" width="500" />

A number of indents and a long list of closing "),),),"

My main purpose was to decrease code size and add code readability.
This package can do it in some cases. Take a look:

<img src="docs/flat_tree.png" width="600" />

Tree hierarchy was reduced to simple list.

# Example

Please check example and learn how to use widget:

<img src="docs/example.png" width="300" />
