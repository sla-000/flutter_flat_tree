# flat_tree

Flat widget tree

## Purpose

Usually Flutter widgets tree code looks somewhere like this:

<img src="https://github.com/sla-000/flutter_flat_tree/blob/master/doc/classic.png" width="500" />

A number of indents and a long list of closing "),),),"

My main purpose was to decrease code size and add code readability.
This package can do it in some cases. Take a look:

Tree hierarchy was reduced to simple list.
